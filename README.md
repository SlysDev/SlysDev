### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Jeremy, a _mobile app developer_ working in Flutter.

-   ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Habitur](https://github.com/SlysDev/habitur), a habit
    building app driven by social accountability.
-   ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Flutter, and React**
-   ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **project organization, and SRP within flutter**
-   ğŸ’¬ Ask me about mobile app development, psychology, and productivity - those are my
    jams!
-   ğŸ“« How to reach me: through [email](mailto:slysdeveloper@gmail.com)
-   âš¡ Fun fact: I eat with my knife/fork swapped - the traditional orientation makes no
    sense, if you really think about it. ğŸ˜‰
